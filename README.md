Problem Statement: A question from Deb Kalyanmoy - Optimization for Engineering Design_ Algorithms and Examples-PHI Learning (2012)

Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover, 
and selection.
In this project I coded GA, using MATLAB. I have solved the question from a famous Optimization book, Deb Kalyanmoy - Optimization for Engineering Design. It was fun and challenging.
